Neon.SSH
========
This package includes SSH/SCP related utility classes for performing operations on remote Linux machines.  These were originally created for configuring a neonKUBE cluster but may have more general uses so we've broken them out into a separate nuget package.

The API design and features included are somewhat random since this was intended for internal use only at the time and there's still code and definitions here that really make sense for the original purpose.  We also reserve the right to refactor this in the future.
