# neonKUBE service [values.yaml] files are used for specifying parameters 
# based on cluster-advice recommendations (e.g. for single-node clusters vs. 
# larger multi-node clusters).
#
# NOTE: Cluster setup will likely replace some or all of these values via [--set]
#       options when deploying this.
#
# We also use this for specifying temporary DEBUG related configurations.
