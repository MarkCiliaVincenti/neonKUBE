        <para>
          Our initial .NET Temporal client implementation was modeled more closely to the Temporal Go client
          and not the Java client.  We discussed this with Maxim and he convinced us that we really should use
          Java as the standard because it's better and it's hard to argue with better.  So we did an extensive
          top-to-bottom refactoring and ended up with something we're pretty happy with.
        </para>
        <para>
          We did want to embrace some .NET capabilies like <codeInline>async/await</codeInline> that are not
          present in the Java world.  We also made a few changes that align with our underlying implementation
          (which pxoxies a Temporal Go client).  So there are some differences, but we tried pretty hard to keep
          the spirit of the Java client alive.  This page outlines the more important differences.

              <para>
                The .NET Temporal client follows the modern C# task conventions by taking advantage of <codeInline>async/await</codeInline>.
                This can dramatically reduce the number of threads required to execute workflows and activities improving scalability.
                As a consequence, we've appended <legacyBold>Async</legacyBold> to many our method names, following the .NET convention.
                We have kept the root Java names though, where they make sense.

                .NET langauges like C# and Visual Basic support properties as first class language elements.  The .NET client
                exposes properties rather than duplicating the Java <codeInline>getXXX()/setXXX()</codeInline> convention.

              <para>
                We use native .NET types like <codeInline>TimeSpan</codeInline> and <codeInline>DateTime</codeInline>

              <para>
                We've combined that capabilities of the Java <codeInline>IServiceClient</codeInline> and <codeInline>WorkflowClient</codeInline>
                types into our <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:Neon.Temporal.TemporalClient</codeEntityReference> class.  This class
                is disposable, following .NET conventions and we added <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:Neon.Temporal.TemporalSettings</codeEntityReference>
                which is used to configure a Temporal client.  These settings can be easily deserialized from JSON or YAML which is handy when
                loading your workflow service configuration from a file (e.g. a Kubernetes pod config).

              <para>
                The Java client does not require that workflow and activity implementations be registered before use
                (which is nice).  The .NET client follows the Go client convention and requires registration.

            <entry>
              <para>
                The Java client uses thread-local storage to expose the static <codeInline>Workflow</codeInline> class
                to threads executing workflows and <codeInline>Activity</codeInline> to threads executing activities.
                These classes return values and perform operations for the workflow or activity associated with the
                thread.  For workflows we use <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:System.Threading.AsyncLocal`1</codeEntityReference>
                internally to implement the <codeInline>static</codeInline> <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:Neon.Temporal.Workflow.Current</codeEntityReference>
                property.  This will be set when your workflow code is invoked and will be available within your workflow
                class as well as any code your workflow calls.  This works because workflows are prohibited from starting
                additional threads.
              </para>
              <alert class="note">
                <para>
                  Code within your workflow class can also reference this state via this shortcut: 
                  <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:Neon.Temporal.WorkflowBase.Workflow</codeEntityReference>
                </para>
              </alert>
              <para>
                We did not implement a similar ambient property for activities because activities are allowed to
                spin up threads and <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:System.Threading.AsyncLocal`1</codeEntityReference>
                won't work as expected for activities that create threads.
              </para>
              <para>
                So instead we require that workflow implementations derive from <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:Neon.Temporal.WorkflowBase</codeEntityReference>
                and activity implementations derive from <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:Neon.Temporal.ActivityBase</codeEntityReference>.
                <codeInline>WorkflowBase</codeInline> exposes the <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:Neon.Temporal.WorkflowBase.Workflow</codeEntityReference>
                property and <codeInline>ActivityBase</codeInline> exposes the <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:Neon.Temporal.ActivityBase.Activity</codeEntityReference>
                property.  These perform the same functions as the corresponding Java types and will look pretty much the same in
                your workflow code to boot.
              </para>

              <para>
                The Java client creates only a single instance of an activity class for each activity implementation and 
                requires that developers take care to ensure that their activity code is thread-safe.  The .NET implementation
                constructs a distinct activity class instance for every activity invoked.  This is a consequence of exposing
                the <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:Neon.Temporal.ActivityBase.Activity</codeEntityReference>
                property with per-actvity invocation properties and methods.  We also believe this is nicer.

              <para>
                C# and Visual Basic support optional arguments.  Many of our APIs take advantage of this to simplify
                the API surface area.

              <para>
                Java and Go types like strings and classes aren't implicitly nullable whereas these are nullable
                in .NET languages.  Java and Go deal with this by using wrapper types in some situations.  The
                .NET client uses the .NET capabilities to simplify some of these types.

              <para>
                The .NET client can optionally be configured with a default Temporal domain and this domain
                will be assumed when the domain isn't specified for an operation.  We added this as a convienence
                for the common situation where all workflow service operations are constrained to a single domain.

                The .NET client doesn't currently provide an in-memory implementation that can be
                used for intensive workflow unit testing.  This is something we'll be adding in the
                future.  In the meantime, we do have the <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:Neon.Xunit.Temporal.TemporalFixture</codeEntityReference>
                which can be used to run unit tests against a real Temporal service running locally
                as a Docker container.

                I suspect that the .NET <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:Neon.Temporal.WorkflowQueue`1</codeEntityReference> class
                is less capable than the Java equivalant, but the Java class isn't really documented.  The .NET class is designed
                for just two scenarios:

                The Java client supports custom data converters for specific workflows and activities as well as
                for the client.  .NET currently supports custom converters at the client level.  This is something
                we may add in the future.
