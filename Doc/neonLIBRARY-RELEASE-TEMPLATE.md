## Highlights:

**TODO:** Write something here!

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.Cadence

This package provides a .NET client for the [Uber Cadence](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/) workflow platform.  This is still a work in progress and some important features need to be implemented.  That being said, most functionality is implemented and we're using this in production using Linux containers for a significant project.  This library is tagged as **release** quality; it's actually probably closer to **preview** quality.

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.Common 

This package includes a few dozen useful types used by other Neon components.  This is a relatively small assembly and is suitable for including in both app and server side applications, including Xamarin iOS and Android applications (we haven't tested UWP).

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.Couchbase

This package extends the standard [CouchbaseNetClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CouchbaseNetClient) package, adding *safe* methods that return the operation result directly, handling transient errors transparently and throwing exceptions for hard errors.  This also includes some configuration related extensions.  You can get started [here](https://doc.neonkube.com/Neon.Couchbase-Overview.htm).

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.Cryptography

This package includes some helpers making MD5 and SHA-* hashing a bit easier and as well as a class intended for encrypting data at rest.  You can get started [here](https://doc.neonkube.com/Neon.Cryptography-Overview.htm).

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.Service

This package includes types that implement much of the boilerplate code required for Docker container or Kubernetes applications.  This includes integrated logging and support for termination signals on Linux and OS/X as well as abstractions you can use to unit test your services.  You can get started [here](https://doc.neonkube.com/Neon.Service-Overview.htm)

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/preview.png"/> Neon.ModelGen

This package is designed to convert compiled .NET interface definitions into data model classes that can support round-trip data transmission without loss in many common scenarios providing a way to help future-proof your applications.  This also can support generating the boilerplate code implementing  `INotifyPropertyChanged` for UX applications well as generating REST service clients.

Most developers won't need to reference this library since the functionally is exposed by this **neon-cli** command:
```
neon generate models ...
```
This is still a work in progress.  The `INotifyPropertyChanged` and REST client generation support works now but the round-trip functionally doesn't work yet.

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.NATS

This package extends the [NATS Scalabable Messaging Platform](https://nats.io/), adding support for round-trip data models generated by **Neon.ModelGen** as well as some other handy utilities.  These extensions are added to the [NATS.Client](https://doc.neonkube.com/N_NATS_Client.htm) and [STAN.Client](https://doc.neonkube.com/N_STAN_Client.htm) namespaces.

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.Service

This package provides some types to help with developing and testing container optimized applications as well as service applications in general.  This includes the `Neon.Service` base class that handles some of the application life cycle related things like logging, reading settings, health monitoring, and handling termination signals.

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/release.png"/> Neon.SSH.NET

This is a semi-clone of the [https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET](>https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET) project which hasn't been supported for a while.  This fixes this issue [#515: Bugfix for "scp: error: unexpected filename](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/pull/515) that was preventing us from connecting to modern Linux distributions.

**Changes:** No significant changes for this release.

### <img src="https://doc.neonkube.com/media/alpha.png"/> Neon.Temporal

**WARNING: This is under construction and is not ready for general use.**

This package provides a .NET client for the [Temporal](https://docs.temporal.io/) workflow platform.

You can get started: [here](https://doc.neonkube.com/Neon.Temporal-Overview.htm)
