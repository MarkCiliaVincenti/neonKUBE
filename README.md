# neonKUBE: Open Source Kubernetes Distribution

This project is in the early stages of becoming yet another Kubernetes Distribution.  The ultimate goal here is to provide an open source distribution of similar quality to expensive enterpise grade distributions and also avoding cloud provider lock-in.  This project also includes several .NET NuGet packages intended to ease the development of Kubernetes services on .NET.

Developers: See [DEVELOPER.md](Doc/DEVELOPER.md) for setup instructions.
